abstract: Germanium-based nanostructures have attracted increasing attention due to
  favourable electrical and optical properties, which are tunable on the nanoscale.
  High densities of germanium nanocrystals are synthesized via electrochemical etching,
  making porous germanium an appealing nanostructured material for a variety of applications.
  In this work, we have demonstrated highly tunable electrical conductivity in mesoporous
  germanium layers by conducting a systematic study varying crystallite size using
  thermal annealing, with experimental conductivities ranging from 0.6 to 33 (×10−3)
  Ω−1 cm−1. The conductivity of as-prepared mesoporous germanium with 70% porosity
  and crystallite size between 4 and 10 nm is shown to be ∼0.9 × 10−3 Ω−1 cm−1, 5
  orders of magnitude smaller than that of bulk p-type germanium. Thermal annealing
  for 10 min at 400 °C further reduced the conductivity; however, annealing at 450
  °C caused a morphological transformation from columnar crystallites to interconnecting
  granular crystallites and an increase in conductivity by two orders of magnitude
  relative to as-prepared mesoporous germanium caused by reduced influence of surface
  states. We developed an electrostatic model relating the carrier concentration and
  mobility of p-type mesoporous germanium to the nanoscale morphology. Correlation
  within an order of magnitude was found between modelled and experimental conductivities,
  limited by variation in sample uniformity and uncertainty in void size and fraction
  after annealing. Furthermore, theoretical results suggest that mesoporous germanium
  conductivity could be tuned over four orders of magnitude, leading to optimized
  hybrid devices.
