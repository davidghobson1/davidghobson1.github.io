abstract: In this study, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
  GPT-4 to extract and analyze the latent narrative messaging in climate change-related
  news articles from North American and Chinese media. By deﬁning “narrative messaging”
  as the intrinsic moral or lesson of a story, we apply our model to a dataset of
  approximately 15,000 news articles in English and Mandarin, categorized by climate-related
  topics and ideological groupings. Our ﬁndings reveal distinct differences in the
  narrative values emphasized by different cultural and ideological contexts, with
  North American sources often focusing on individualistic and crisis-driven themes,
  while Chinese sources emphasize developmental and cooperative narratives. This work
  demonstrates the potential of LLMs in understanding and inﬂuencing climate communication,
  offering new insights into the collective belief systems that shape public discourse
  on climate change across different cultures.
